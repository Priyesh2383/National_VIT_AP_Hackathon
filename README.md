# National_VIT_AP_Hackathon
#To run the code you can select any of two options
Option 1:-You will have to install jupyter notebook on your system.
         -Store dataset file in local storage and fetch it using its path.
           We have created a dataset specific for our projects which drive links is as follows:-
           https://drive.google.com/file/d/10rRF-ms2Or_LsO_wURf2ZifjQhr6PSC4/view?usp=sharing
         -You can store both dataset and python code file in same folder.
         -For the code to run without any error Python and its modules should be insatalled.
         -We had also installing required modules in our code in case any required module is not installed.
         -To send sms we have used twilio api but it can only send sms to registered number( Here i had used my own number). You can change twilio credentials to send sms that will be send if any particular anamolous action happening for more than 30 sec.

Option 2:- You could run this project in google colab
         - You will have to store dataset in the google drive 
         - you will have to mount your google drive to your code and pass its path
